# Project overview

A simple contact list app, created as an assignment for TeaCode interview process.
Uses Tailwind as the CSS framework with basic HTML elements and Axios + React Query for the request.
The rest is pure React (hooks, methods, etc.).
I used React with Typescript to make the code cleaner and easily understandable.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start / yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This is all that is required to run the app.
Since the app is a single page, after going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000),
you will be able to check all of the functionalities.
